She is learning to pick the videos she wants to watch. Her parents love it as well. Now it frees up their smart phones for their use. I purchased the 7\" for my son when he was 1.5 years old, that one broke and while waiting for the replacement they came out with a 16gb version which I got him, he loved it. I now just saw the 8\" with stereo and more memory. He is almost 3, and plays a lot of learning games, for numbers letters, puzzles and more. Remember this is for kids, and things like Alexa are not important and I don't want my kid having that option anyway. This tablet with the lesser price tag than a appple ipad is far less worry fora 3 yr old to have and own to watch with you while you both are together on the couch at night, a must for a first time tablet owner who has a young child.
